# AI and Machine Learning for Coders, Laurence Moroney

This book primarily focuses on exploring how to model artificial intelligence, with TensorFlow being the main library covered.

The initial chapters demonstrate how to create a model from scratch.

Most interesting chapters (personal highlights):
- Chapter 3, Transfer Learning section: provides an approach to transfer learning
- Chapters 5 & 6: deep dive into natural language processing, explaining how words are converted into numbers and how they are given meaning within a vector space
- Chapter 12: introduces TensorFlow Lite, a library for using pre-trained models on mobile devices and other platforms. It demonstrates how to convert models to their lite counterpart and how to extract prediction outputs. Various optimization methods are shown to: reduce consumption, decrease model size, etc. The remainder focuses on showcasing applications in Android and iOS.
